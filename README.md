# 100DaysofCodeARMTemplates

As I have decided to  move from Infra to DevOps, I have decided to learn IaC.
I am learning Azure and Azure DevOps already so thought to continue learning Azure ARM Templates.
To keep myself on the track, I will share all the progress under #100DaysofCodeARMTemplates.
Here are the resources I plan to use at the start.

And offcourse my Subscription of Azure.

This repository will be used to track my Journey in IaC Azure ARM Templates.
I will keep on adding new resources as I start to search and use them.
